Dear Kitty,

Welcome to 'Narcissus', my lovely flower shop, and sorry I can’t be there to meet you! I hope you and your parents are doing well. To be honest I was surprised when your mother called me, but it is the perfect time for you to learn how to be responsible and for me to have some free time and rest a little while.
A month is not such a long time.

The flowers won’t take a long time to care for them. I left you some seeds to start you off, but don’t worry, when you pick flowers they often drop seeds too, so you should have plenty of them.
Just take a seed and put it in the ground. That’s it. Be patient with them, some take longer than others. If you tend to them, they sometimes grow quicker.

Anyway, if customer comes, go to the store and sell them flowers. Townspeople are quite alright. If anyone asks, I’m somewhere on vacation, nowhere specific.

Oh, and be a dear and read my mail, just in case something important comes up!

See you soon!

Aunt Constance
